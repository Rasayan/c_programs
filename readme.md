# Hello Everyone

This is just a C language repo that contains(will contain) programs related to C. PLease hold your horses as I will keep adding two to three program(s) every day. There would be repositories in Python and Rust as well, make sure to check them out if you want. Don't forget to leave a star, that's what keeps me motivated.

To run any of the C programs, follow the CLI commands /-

```c
gcc Prims.c
./a.out
```

Remeber to replace 'Prims.c' with the filename you want to execute!

### Happy Coding ^_^
